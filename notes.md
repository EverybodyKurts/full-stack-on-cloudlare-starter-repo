# Notes

## Exports in `packages/data-ops/package.json`

This exports configuration in the package.json file defines the public API for an npm package by specifying exactly what modules can be imported by consumers and where they're located. This is a modern approach to package distribution that provides fine-grained control over the package's interface while supporting both TypeScript and JavaScript consumers.

### Module Resolution Strategy

Each export entry follows a consistent pattern with two key properties: types points to TypeScript declaration files (.d.ts) in the dist directory, while default points to the corresponding compiled JavaScript files (.js). This dual mapping ensures that TypeScript projects get full type information while JavaScript projects can still import and use the functionality. The Node.js module resolver automatically selects the appropriate file based on the importing project's configuration.

### Organized Export Structure

The exports are logically organized by functionality areas:

- `./database` - Provides core database functionality as a single entry point
- `./queries/*` - Exposes database query utilities with wildcard support for multiple query modules
- `./zod-schema/*` - Makes validation schemas available, likely for API input/output validation
- `./durable-objects-helpers` - Offers utilities for Cloudflare Workers' Durable Objects (edge computing storage)
- `./auth` - Provides authentication functionality through the better-auth library

### Import Path Benefits

This configuration enables clean, semantic import statements like `import { db } from 'package-name/database'` or `import { userSchema } from 'package-name/zod-schema/users'`. The wildcard patterns (`/*`) are particularly powerful as they allow consumers to import specific sub-modules without the package needing to explicitly list every possible export. This approach prevents internal implementation details from being accidentally exposed while creating a stable, well-defined API surface that can evolve independently from the internal file structure.

The structure suggests this is likely a shared data layer package in a monorepo, providing database access, validation schemas, and authentication utilities to multiple applications or services.
